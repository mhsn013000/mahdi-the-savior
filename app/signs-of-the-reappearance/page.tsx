          Signs of the Reappearance of Imam Mahdi (a.j.)
        </h1>
        <p>
          The signs of the reappearance are divided into definite and
          non-definite signs. Definite signs are those whose occurrence is
          certain, and Imam Mahdi (a.j.) will not reappear until they take
          place. Non-definite signs, on the other hand, are those that are not
          confirmed to be certain, and the Imam Mahdi (a.j.) may reappear even
          if they do not occur.

            Sheikh Mufid, in his book Al-Irshad, provided a list of the signs of
            the reappearance. Referring to the phrase “Wallahu A‘lam” (And Allah
            knows best) at the end of the list, some have suggested that Sheikh
            Mufid expressed doubt about some of these signs.

          Signs of the Reappearance in Other Religions

            In Judaism and Christianity, certain signs have been mentioned
            regarding the coming of the savior, some of which are similar to the
            signs of reappearance mentioned in Islamic traditions.
          </p>
          <ul className="ml-4 list-inside list-disc">
            <li>
              Jews believe that the spread of corruption and the prevalence of
              war and chaos are among the signs of the coming of the Messiah
              (Mashiach).
            </li>
            <li>
              Christians, on the other hand, believe that the Antichrist—or
              Dajjal—is a person or group who denies or rejects the messiahship
              of Jesus (pbuh). The Antichrist will rise at the end of times, and
              when Jesus (pbuh) returns, he will defeat him.
